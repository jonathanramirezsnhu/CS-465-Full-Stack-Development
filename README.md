# CS-465-Full-Stack-Development

Express HTML uses javascrip strings ot files to render plain HTML. You can use the res.send() method ask express to set the content-type headers. Javascript is simply the programming language that is used to bring life to the static HTML pages. A single page application is a web application that loads a single page and it updates the contents in a dynamic way through the use of javascript APIs.
The difference between javascript and JSON is that JSON is a method of organizing data. The synstax of JSON was inspired by the syntax of Javascript.
This course has helped me in reaching my professional goals by learning more about software development and how different tools can be used to create a fully functional application. I learned how to create a web application using templates and how to convert them from static HTML pages to dynamic HTML pages using the MEAN stack.
